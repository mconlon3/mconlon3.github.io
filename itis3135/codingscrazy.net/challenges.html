            <h2>Fun Challenges</h2>
            
            <!--Each challenge is shown view a Bullet point and some description.-->
            <p>Feeling confident? Or just looking for something harder?</p>
            <p>Try out these challenges!</p>
            <p>Here are five projects you can try, as well as the skills they will test and reasons why it is a challenge.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Edit a Wikipedia page.
                </li>
                <p>HTML doesn't mean you have to start from scratch!</p>
                <p>Since websites are built using HTML, that also means you can edit them.</p>
                <p>Try editing a page of Wikipedia (don't add any misinformation!) using HTML.</p>
                <li>
                    Make a website about yourself.
                </li>
                <p>Websites can be an easy way to introduce yourself.</p>
                <p>You can list a lot of information at once using lists.</p>
                <p>Use a stylesheet to make the website look nice.</p>
                <li>
                    Create a fake product page.
                </li>
                <p>Incorporate images onto your website.</p>
                <p>Add multiple pages if you think you can, as well as a way to navigate the website.</p>
                <p>An embedded video could add extra realism.</p>
                <li>
                    Music Player
                </li>
                <p>Try to create a music player.</p>
                <p>This project will test your ability to incorporate clickable objects.</p>
                <p>You will also have to create a file structure to store the audio files. (Unless you stream them another way.)</p>
                <li>
                    Portfolio
                </li>
                <p>Show off all your HTML projects in a portfolio.</p>
                <p>Make sure to keep the website interesting instead of just a list of projects.</p>
                <p>Try adding images, slideshows, and clickable objects!</p>
            </ol>
