                If you've ever wanted to learn how to code your own website, this is the place!
                HTML is the foundation of websites, this very website was built using HTML, as well as other components.
                HTML is useful whether you're creating websites for blogging, photography, portfolios, or just for fun.
                The HTML language is easy to learn even without experience! The more you practice, the more complex creations you'll be able to make.

                but we also encourage intermediate coders to explore
                our website as we provide fun coding ideas, challenges,
                and a gallery to view HTML projects.
