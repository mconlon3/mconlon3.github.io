                <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://www.mercari.com/">Mercari</a></h3>
                <p>This is Mercari's website.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: The header is a different color than the rest of the webpage, providing a distinction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition: Mercari sticks to a color pallete of blue and white. The previews for different sections of the website all look similar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: The header is aligned at the top, text is aligned to the left. The most important categories are near the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: Similar categories are grouped together, all the important information like the search bar, login, and cart are in the header.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">Spacejam</a></h3>
                <p>This is the Spacejam website from 1996.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast: This website uses many dark highly saturated colors, the background is very busy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition: Colors are not repeated, every planet looks different. The planet titles are yellow, but every other piece of text is red.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment: Everything is centered and the clickable planets are scattered. There is no header or other way of navigating the website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: The Sitemap is simply another planet and is not distinct in anyway. It should not be grouped with them since it is unique.
                    </li>
                </ul>
